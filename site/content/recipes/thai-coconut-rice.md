## Directions

1. Rub the **oil** over the bottom of a deep-sided pot. You will also need a tight-fitting lid.
2. Place the **rice**, **coconut milk**, **water**, and **salt** in the pot and set over medium-high to high heat. Stir occasionally to keep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning.
3. Once the coconut-water has begun to gently bubble, stop stirring and reduce heat to low or medium-low. You want the water to simmer.
4. Cover tightly with a lid and let simmer *15-20 minutes*, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. To check, pull the rice aside with a fork. If most of the coconut milk-water is gone, go on to the next step.
5. Turn off the heat, but leave the covered pot on the burner another *5 to 10 minutes*, or until you're ready to eat.
6. Tip: Your Coconut Rice will stay warm this way for up to one hour or more. That's great for when you're expecting company or waiting for your spouse to get home.
7. When you're ready to serve the rice, remove the lid and fluff rice with a fork or chopsticks. Taste-test the rice for salt, adding a little more if needed.
8. Serve right out of the pot, or transfer to a serving bowl. Enjoy
