## Directions

1. Heat **oil** in a large skillet over medium heat. Add **chicken** and brown on all sides, set aside.
2. In the same skillet, saut√© **onion**, **bell pepper**, **poblano pepper** and **garlic**. Cook and stir until veggies are soft and slightly caramelized. Stir in **chili powder**, **cumin** and **cinnamon** and cook *3 minutes* longer.
3. Add **tomatoes**, **raisins**, **chipotle peppers**, **chicken broth**, **beer**, **peanut butter**, **sugar** and **salt**. Bring to a simmer and cook *20 minutes*, stirring often.
4. Pour the sauce into a blender or food processor and add chocolate. Cover and blend until smooth (or use an immersion blender).
5. Transfer the chicken into a dutch oven, or a deep heavy cooking pot, or skillet. Pour **sauce** over **chicken**. Cover and simmer for about *45 minutes*, or until chicken is cooked through.
6. Serve warm over cooked white rice with warm tortillas. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with fresh cilantro, if desired.
7. You will have lots of sauce left-over. Drizzle extra sauce over rice and chicken. The sauce can be frozen and served with chicken later on.
